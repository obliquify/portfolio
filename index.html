    <title>A Little Something About Me</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Humans have a complex set of memories stored in their
    brains. Mine happens to be one mostly associated with
    adventure. That is part of who I am, one who wanders around
    exploring the various avenues of the world and in the process
    finding myself as well.</p>

    <h1>Projects</h1>
      <p>During my freshman year in college, I took a coding class.
        There I was able to work on a few coding projects that ranged
        from creating Plinko to coding up a receipt lister. </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Plinko</li>
      <li>Bread and Cakes restaurant order manager</li>
      <li>Hot Plate</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
      <p>Recently I just started working at BYU OIT's support.
        Working with the technology behind the services BYU provides
        has been quite the learning experience. I've learned a variety
        of technology things ranging from networking to account management.</p>
