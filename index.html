      <h4>A Particle Of Imagination</h4>
      <p class="introduction">Humans have a complex set of memories stored in their
      brains. Mine happens to be one mostly associated with
      adventure. That is part of who I am, one who wanders around
      exploring the various avenues of the world and in the process
      finding myself as well.</p>

      <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p class="projects">During my freshman year in college, I took a coding class.
          There I was able to work on a few coding projects that ranged
          from creating Plinko to coding up a receipt lister. </p>


      <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p class="workexperience">Recently I just started working at BYU OIT's support.
          Working with the technology behind the services BYU provides
          has been quite the learning experience. I've learned a variety
          of technology things ranging from networking to account management.</p>
